  * debian/control:
    - remove deprecated transitional packages (only from maverick ppa or early
      natty alpha)
    - don't dep on gnome-session-bin
    - remove the -dev package, uneeded for a private library internal to this
      source
    - remove bzr build-dep, we will refresh the pot with dh_translations
  * debian/rules:
    - build with dh7 now
    - buid with --fail-missing and purging installed but not shipped private
      headers
  * debian/unity-2d-launcher.preinst:
    - removed, deprecated as it was for the ppa migration
  * debian/libunity-2d-private0.post*
    - removed: ldconfig is generated directly by dh_makeshlibs as we don't pass
      -n anymore
  * don't install unity-2d session as it's in gnome-session now
  * debian/unity-2d.install
    debian/20_ubuntu-2d-gconf-default
    debian/20_ubuntu-2d-gconf-mandatory
    debian/gconf/ubuntu-2d.default.path
    debian/gconf/ubuntu-2d.mandatory.path:
    - remove uneeded defaults and mandatory
    - remove some deprecated keys
    - the session is now called ubuntu-2d and not unity-2d anymore
  * debian/unity-2d.preinst, debian/unity-2d.postinst
    debian/unity-2d.postrm:
    - take into account the natty -> oneiric migration with session name change
